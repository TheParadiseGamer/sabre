# Project Sabre
### Overview
Project Sabre is a Discord bot created upon the Discord.js wrappers for NodeJS.
*The Trello for this project is mentioned in the Issues page.*
### Supported Servers
At this time, Sabre is being hosted solely in its development server, DANET.
The developers are mentioned while using the **!devteam** command.
### Future Support
Project Sabre is a work in progress. We plan to extend support to the Alaska Discord Server at some point after the code gets a good squeaky clean scrubbing.
### How to Contribute
Message me on Discord and I will work with you to open up a new branch for your development contributions. At this time there is only one main programmer, (myself). There are plenty of resources available on my private Trello page to get started on working on Sabre's source code.
### Other
If you download this and try running it, don't come crying to me if it doesn't work. This bot is a work in progress and requires the discord.js library, and NodeJS 8+, as mentioned on the official discord.js website. It's also a work-in-progress, which means bugs, bugs, bugs.
