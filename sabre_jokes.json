    "text": "Three bankers go to a bar. They have a couple drinks. When it was time to leave, they couldn't find a place to stay for the night because all the hotels and motels around were full. The bankers begin to argue, and eventually someone overhears them bickering and suggests they stay at their barn for the night, free of charge. The only catch was there was only one big bed. The bankers think it's not the best idea, but it was plausable and they had nowhere else to go. So, the bankers went and stayed at the barn for the night. The next morning, the banker on the left says 'I had the most amazing dream! I dreamt some hot chick was jerking me off.' The banker on the right says, 'Hey! Me too! I also had a dream some hot girl was jerking me off.' The banker in the middle wakes up and goes, 'I dreamt I was skiing!'"
